		<p>This is Cherry Ho!</p>
<p>I am a F4 student and I have been studying in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section) for 10 years. I am living in Macau currently. I enjoy having outer-school competitions in both the categories of Mathematics and Science, they are great experience! I participated a competition this summer, I really find it interesting in both searching information other than knowledge from lessons and building up small machines on our own. I am looking forward to the next opportunity in participating in such activities.</p>
